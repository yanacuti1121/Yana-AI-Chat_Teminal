//! Shared locking primitive — ADR-008 (`docs/adr/ADR-008-shared-locking-infrastructure.md`).
//!
//! Atomic `mkdir` as the mutex: portable on every POSIX filesystem this repo
//! targets, no external binary (`flock(1)` isn't preinstalled on macOS), no
//! new crate. This is the canonical implementation bash/Python/Node call
//! sites delegate to via `yana-rt lock ...`, matching the same
//! present-else-fallback pattern this repo already uses for
//! `yana-rt guard <subcommand>` (see `guard-destructive.sh`,
//! `token-budget-guard.sh`).
//!
//! Lock name is derived from the target resource identifier (usually a file
//! path) via [`lock_name_for`] — a sanitized prefix plus a SHA-256 hash
//! suffix, so bash/Python/Node/Rust callers touching the *same* resource
//! contend for the *same* lock directory without needing to agree on
//! anything beyond the resource string itself. This is what closes the
//! cross-language race between `risk-scorer.sh` (Python) and
//! `token-budget-guard.sh` (Node) both writing
//! `core/memory/L2_session/token-budget.json` — a fix confined to one
//! language couldn't do that.
//!
//! Stale-lock reclaim uses a fencing-token rename, not an unconditional
//! `rmdir`. `core/hooks/audit-log.sh`'s original lock (this repo's first
//! working `mkdir` lock, proven in production) reclaims by unconditional
//! `rmdir` once a lock directory's mtime exceeds the timeout — which has a
//! real race: a holder that's merely *slow* (not dead) past the timeout can
//! be reclaimed by a second process while still writing, producing two
//! simultaneous holders. `rename()` is atomic, so when two reclaimers race,
//! exactly one wins (the other gets `ENOENT` on the already-renamed source)
//! — see [`try_reclaim_stale`].
